Writing apps for Blackberry10 was an amazing experience. It was rewarding for two primary reasons - 
1. Sharing your project with random people around the world and to see them use it is awesome!
2. Applying machine learning algorithms to real world problems is even better!

Most of my apps were a mix of Qt/QML, Cascades and an experiment in machine learning.
Down below are some of the apps I developed. Some I published, some I could never finish.

Most of my projects resided on Bitbucket (most still do!). I also hosted a website on wordpress to manage my posts and write about projects. The whole thing was a bit clunky at best. Injecting JS was a pain and was generally restrictive. The move to GitHub has restored some sanity. Writing in markdown is clean and Jekyll provides a good high level abstraction for most posting needs - also, let's me write JS very easily! For example, adding [JS to this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-7-27-texture-repeat %}) to run WebGL/Phaser was a breeze!
Needless to say, having my projects moved to GitHub was the obvious next step. 

As I move the content over, some posts are still stubs. So bear with me.
